There are no standard file extensions for FASTA formatted files. 
However, common ones are .fa and .fsa. NCBI distribute their genomic 
data in FASTA format using four different extensions: 
	.fna for whole genomic DNA sequences
	.faa for protein coding sequences (CDS)
	.ffn for the untranslated nucleotide sequences for each CDS
	.frn for nucleotide sequences of RNA related features
